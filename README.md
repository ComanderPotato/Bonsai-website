# Bonsai-website
A frontend project I did found on [Frontendpractice.com](https://www.frontendpractice.com/) to practice. Based off the [Bonsai](https://www.hellobonsai.com/pricing) website listed.

## Finished product
Here you can find the finish [project](https://stellular-pithivier-d4c160.netlify.app/). The HTML is simple, using semantic HTML5 markup and the BEM naming convetion to make it clean and readable. Use of CSS properties flex and grid was used to create the layout of the page as a whole and the card sections. Typescript used to make the accordion component interactive.
